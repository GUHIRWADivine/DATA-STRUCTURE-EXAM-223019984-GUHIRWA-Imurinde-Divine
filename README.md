# 🎓 University Course Enrollment System (C++ OOP)

## 📘 Description

A C++ program that simulates a basic **university course enrollment system** using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as:

- **Abstract classes**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Dynamic memory allocation**
- **Pointer arithmetic**

Implemented fully in a **single file (`main.cpp`)** for simplicity and easy integration.

---

## 🧩 Features

- `Module` struct to represent a course
- Abstract base class `Person`
- Derived classes:
  - `Student`: manages enrolled modules
  - `Instructor`: manages taught modules
- Dynamic arrays for modules (resized using pointer arithmetic)
- Dynamic array of `Person*` pointers for polymorphic storage
- `addPerson()` and `removePerson()` methods to manage people
- Uses virtual functions for polymorphic output with `showInfo()`

---

## 🧱 Data Structures

### `struct Module`
```cpp
struct Module {
    char code[8];
    char title[30];
    int credits;
};
````

### Class Hierarchy

```
Person (abstract)
├── Student
└── Instructor
```

### Key Components

* `Person** people`: dynamically resizable array to store both students and instructors
* Pointer arithmetic used to manipulate arrays of `Module` and `Person`

---

## 🛠️ How to Build and Run

### 🔧 Compile

```bash
g++ -o university main.cpp
```

### ▶️ Run

```bash
./university
```

---

## 💡 Sample Output

```
Student: Alice (ID: S101)
  Module: CS101, Intro to CS, 3 credits

Instructor: Dr. Bob (ID: I201)
  Teaches: CS101, Intro to CS, 3 credits

After removal:
Instructor: Dr. Bob (ID: I201)
  Teaches: CS101, Intro to CS, 3 credits
```

---

## 🧹 Memory Management

* All dynamic arrays are managed manually (no STL used).
* Destructors deallocate memory properly to prevent leaks.

---

## 📁 File Structure

```
UniversityEnrollment/
├── main.cpp       # Complete code (classes + main)
└── README.md      # Project documentation
```

---

## 🧠 C++ Concepts Demonstrated

* ✅ Abstract base classes and inheritance
* ✅ Virtual functions and polymorphism
* ✅ Manual memory management
* ✅ Pointer arithmetic for arrays
* ✅ Dynamic resizing of arrays

The Meaning and Importance of the Program
The provided code is a very basic program written in C++. While it may appear to be extremely simple, it holds value in understanding fundamental programming concepts. Let’s dive into what this code means and why it’s important for beginners in programming.
The Code Breakdown
1.	#include <iostream>:
o	This line is a preprocessor directive that includes the input-output stream library (iostream) in your program. The iostream library provides essential functionality for handling input and output operations, such as printing text to the screen or receiving user input.
2.	using namespace std;
o	This line tells the compiler to use the standard namespace (std). The C++ Standard Library contains classes and functions, such as cout, cin, and endl, which are placed in the std namespace. By using std, you don’t have to write std::cout or std::cin each time you use these functions. It simplifies the syntax of the program.
3.	int main() {}
o	The main function is the entry point of every C++ program. It is where the program starts its execution. Without a main() function, the program would not run.
o	The return type of the main() function is int, meaning that it returns an integer value to indicate the success or failure of the program. In this case, return 0; indicates that the program has run successfully.
4.	return 0;
o	The return 0; statement marks the end of the main function. Returning 0 is a conventional way to signal that the program has completed without any errors or issues. If the program had errors, it could return a non-zero value to indicate failure.
Significance and Importance
While the program is simple, its components serve a critical role in teaching beginners about how C++ programs are structured. Let's explore why this seemingly small program is important:
1.	Introduction to Syntax:
o	This program introduces beginners to the syntax of C++, which is important to understand before diving into more complex code. Even though it doesn't do much, it lays the foundation for how code is organized in a C++ program. For example, understanding how to structure a program with #include, main(), and return values is essential for writing more advanced programs later.
2.	Understanding the Main Function:
o	The main() function is where every C++ program starts. Even if the program is as simple as returning 0, this demonstrates the core structure that is needed in all programs. This is a vital concept because every program must have a main() function for execution to start.
3.	Return Values and Program Execution:
o	Returning 0 from the main() function is a convention in C++ that tells the operating system that the program has executed successfully. Understanding return values helps beginners grasp the concept of successful or unsuccessful program execution, which is critical when debugging and running larger, more complex programs.
4.	The Importance of Libraries and Namespaces:
o	The use of #include <iostream> and using namespace std; introduces beginners to the concept of libraries and namespaces. Libraries provide pre-written code that simplifies the development process, and namespaces help avoid naming conflicts in larger projects. These are foundational concepts for organizing and structuring more complex programs.
5.	Confidence and Motivation for Beginners:
o	For new programmers, writing and running a program that works (even if it just returns 0) is a source of motivation. It helps them gain confidence in the programming environment and the tools they are using. Starting with something simple like this ensures that the student can focus on understanding how a program runs, rather than getting bogged down by complex code.
The Path to Advanced Programming
This code may be basic, but it is a stepping stone toward more advanced concepts. By first understanding how the program structure works, a beginner can build on this knowledge to:
•	Start using input/output to interact with the user.
•	Learn how to use variables, data types, and functions.
•	Work with control flow statements (if-else, loops).
•	Understand memory management and object-oriented programming.
Every large and complex software system begins with these fundamental concepts. Without mastering these simple building blocks, it would be difficult to write more sophisticated programs.
Conclusion
The basic program #include <iostream>, using namespace std;, int main() { return 0; } is simple, yet essential. It introduces core programming concepts such as syntax, structure, the main function, return values, and libraries. For beginners, it is a vital first step in understanding how a C++ program works, and it serves as a confidence booster as they begin their programming journey.
By mastering these foundational concepts, learners are prepared to move on to more complex tasks, such as building interactive applications, solving problems, and developing software that can have real-world applications. Every complex program starts with this simple understanding of structure,

o	Returning 0 from the main() function is a convention in C++ that tells the operating system that the program has executed successfully. Understanding return values helps beginners grasp the concept of successful or unsuccessful program execution, which is critical when debugging and running larger, more complex programs.
4.	The Importance of Libraries and Namespaces:
o	The use of #include <iostream> and using namespace std; introduces beginners to the concept of libraries and namespaces. Libraries provide pre-written code that simplifies the development process, and namespaces help avoid naming conflicts in larger projects. These are foundational concepts for organizing and structuring more complex programs.
5.	Confidence and Motivation for Beginners:
o	For new programmers, writing and running a program that works (even if it just returns 0) is a source of motivation. It helps them gain confidence in the programming environment and the tools they are using. Starting with something simple like this ensures that the student can focus on understanding how a program runs, rather than getting bogged down by complex code.
The Path to Advanced Programming
This code may be basic, but it is a stepping stone toward more advanced concepts. By first understanding how the program structure works, a beginner can build on this knowledge to:
•	Start using input/output to interact with the user.
•	Learn how to use variables, data types, and functions.
•	Work with control flow statements (if-else, loops).
•	Understand memory management and object-oriented programming.
Every large and complex software system begins with these fundamental concepts. Without mastering these simple building blocks, it would be difficult to write more sophisticated programs.
Conclusion
The basic program #include <iostream>, using namespace std;, int main() { return 0; } is simple, yet essential. It introduces core programming concepts such as syntax, structure, the main function, return values, and libraries. For beginners, it is a vital first step in understanding how a C++ program works, and it serves as a confidence booster as they begin their programming journey.
By mastering these foundational concepts, learners are prepared to move on to more complex tasks, such as building interactive applications, solving problems, and developing software that can have real-world applications. Every complex program starts with this simple understanding of structure,
